    """Identifies files for the most recent complete simulation.

    As files arrive at HydroShare from NOAA, a folder for the forecast
    date is created although all files may have not yet arrived from
    NOAA. This function checks that all files for the simulation are
    present before returning details of that simulation.

    Each simulation is represented as a dictionary describing product
    type, simulation date, and whether all expected files are present,
    and it also includes a list of filenames, e.g.
    {'product': 'long_range_mem1',
     'date': '20170401t06-00',
     'is_complete': True,
     'files': ['nwm...f006.conus.nc', 'nwm...f012.conus.nc', ...],
     'links': ['http...', ...]}

    Args:
        product: String product name, e.g., 'short_range'.

    Returns:
        An ordered dictionary of simulation dictionaries, indexed by
        product and date, e.g., 'long_range_mem1_20170401t06-00', or
        empty dictionary if no complete simulations found.
